# tensorFlow

**Quick Note to setting up your IDE
Installing TensorFlow
mkdir TensorFlow
cd TensorFlow

// Create a virtualenv
python3.7 -m venv .

sudo easy_install pip 
or pip install --upgrade pip (if you have pip already, my version at this time is pip version 19.1.1)
pip3 install tensorflow

Errors I got but we can continue on until we need matplotlib
// A library for creating static, animated, and interactive visuals
ERROR: matplotlib 1.3.1 requires nose, which is not installed.
ERROR: matplotlib 1.3.1 requires tornado, which is not installed.
